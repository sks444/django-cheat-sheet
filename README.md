## Designing Models

- Use singular model name. E.g `class Organization(models.Model)` and not `class Organizations(models.Model)`

- Use snake case for model field names. E.g. `first_name` and not `FirstName`

- [Many-to-one relationships](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/db/examples/many_to_one/): Use  ForeignKey to define ManyToOne relationship. E.g.
  If you want to design models for team and player where Many Player can belong to One Team do:

  ```python

    class Team(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

    class Player(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

        # Many Player can belong to one team
        team = models.ForeignKey(Team, ...)
  ```

- Reverse Relationships: Use `related_name` if you want to get all the players for a team.

```python
    class Player(models.Model):
        team = models.ForeignKey(Team, related_name='players', ...)

    # Now you can do:
    team1 = Team.objects.get(name='team1')

    # Get all the players for this team
    players = team1.players.all()
```

- Use `related_query_name` if you want get all the teams that has a Player named `Krishna`

```python
    class Player(models.Model):
        team = models.ForeignKey(
            Team,
            related_name='players',
            related_query_name='player',
            ...
        )

    # Now you can do:
    teams = Team.objects.filter(player__name='Krishna')
```

- [One-to-one relationships](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/db/examples/one_to_one/) Use OneToOne Field when defining One-To-One Relationships. E.g. Suppose that each Team has a Coach. And one Coach can only belong to one Team.

  ```python
    class Team(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

    class Coach(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        ...
        ...
        team = OneToOneField(Coach, ...)
  ```

  There is one confusion that you might think of is that in which Model you should add the OneToOneField. In that case one rule that I follow is "Don't disturbe the existing models if not needed.":
  Suppose that you added `coach` field to `Team` model instead of the above.

  - It will create two migrations
  - You will have to update team exclusively while creating Coach.

    ```python
        # Before
        team1 = Team.objects.get(name='team1')
        Coach.objects.create(name='tt', team=team1)

        # After
        team1 = Team.objects.get(name='team1')
        coach = Coach.objects.create(name='tt')
        team1.coach = coach
        team1.save()
    ```

- ForeignKey and OneToOneField accept one required parameter `on_delete` which decides what will happen to your model when the data it is linked to gets deleted. For example look at the following:

    ```python
    class Team(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

    class Player(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

        # Many Player can belong to one team
        team = models.ForeignKey(Team, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    ```

    In the above example `on_delete` is set to `CASCADE` which means that delete all the Players in the team, when the team they are linked to gets deleted. But if it is set to `SET_NULL` it means that keep they players and set the `player.team` to `None` when the team is getting deleted.

- Any changes in your models requires you to run `python manage.py makemigrations` and `python manage.py migrate`
